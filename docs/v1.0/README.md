# Going to deliver data to EGDI?

The EGDI platform has dual purposes. One purpose is to make data from
the GeoERA Scientific projects (GSP's) available and easy to use for
different types of users. The other purpose is to secure that the same
data will be available after the end of the GSP's.

The EGDI platform can handle data delivered to the platform and stored
in its central database or data served to the platform by services
hosted externally to the EGDI.

If data are delivered by services, these data will, of course, only be
available on the platform as long as the services are running.

The general recommendation is to deliver the data by uploading them to the platform. This is because this will give the most coherent and user friendly system and best secure the availability of the data after the end of the project.

In some cases delivering data by services is needed. This is the case for data from online censors delivering data about the hydraulic head from boreholes. These data comes from national monitoring programs where new data are added on a regular base and where the data flow can be maintained in the years after the end of the GeoERA project.

In the section [Delivering data to EGDI](main-content/DeliveringDataToEGDI) you can read about which types of data that can be delivered to the EGDI platform and and about the pros and cons on delivering data by upload or by services.

In the section [Creating spatial data sets](main-content/SpatialData) you can find help on how to create your data sets in a way that make them most usable for the users at the EGDI platform.

Before you can upload data sets or register services in EGDI you must have added metadata describing the data set in EGDI Metadata Catalogue (MIcKA) in the [MIcKA Cook Book](https://czechgeologicalsurvey.github.io/MICKA-Docs/). It is not possible to uploaded data set or register services to EGDI before this have been done.

You can also find more information about the EGDI Metadata Catalogue including a FAQ and training videos here [MIcKA Documentation](https://egdi.geology.cz/catalog/micka/docs).

When you have your data ready (and harmonized) and have added your metadata to the metadata catalogue you can read in this section [Uploading data to EGDI)](main-content/AdministrationModule) how to deliver the data.

We have also added a list of terms used in this documentation in the section [Used terms](main-content/ListOfTerms.md).

## Short introduction to the EGDI WebGIS

The EGDI WebGIS has standard WebGIS functionality such as:

* Zoom and pan
* Turn layers on and off
* From the layer info box users can access zoom to layer and access metadata
* Apply filter on the data set (if uploaded to EGDI)
* Download the data set as a GeoPackage (if uploaded to EGDI as GeoPackage)
* Click info

## Short introduction to the EGDI search system

The EGDI search system let the end user search the system. The search system will search through metadata, documents in the repository and the content of the datasets uploaded to EGDI.

## Short introduction to the EGDI document repository

The EGDI document repository let you store documents and pictures on the EGDI platform. When uploaded yoy will receive a static URL (a URI) to the file. This URI lets you refer to file from the EGDI WebGIS and homepages.

## Short introduction to the EGDI metadata catalogue

## Short introduction to the EGDI administration module

The EGDI administration module (that this documentation describes) let data providers upload spatial data and filet to the EGDI platform and define maps and layers.

## Webinar about metadata

March 11. 2021 – A webinar was set up about entering metadata into the EGDI Metadata catalogue (MIcKA, Version 6.0). This is a requirement in order to upload a spatial data file to the EGDI Document Repository.

Presentations:

1. Cookbook for creating metadata records using the EGDI Metadata Catalogue (MIcKA, version 6.0). Pavla Kramolišová (Czech Geological Survey - Metadata Support)

2. A walk through on creating a metadata entry in the EGDI Metadata catalogue followed by an upload demonstration of a GeoPackage to the EGDI Document Repository. Trevor Alcorn (Geological Survey Ireland - MINDeSEA, Work Package 8)

The webinar was arranged by James Trench (Liaison Officer to Raw Materials) under Work Package 2 for the GeoERA Raw Material projects.
